# Practice-derived gotchas (every one hit for real, 2026-07-02/03)

## The sim sandbox (single most important section)

1a. **The sim's code source is the `game_url` HTML.** The sim (colocated with
   the sg relays, `/data/sim-service`, warmup triggered by the first
   `player_action`) fetches game_url — plain fetch, no host allowlist —
   extracts EVERY inline `<script>` (skips any tag with `src=`), and
   vm-executes each body with stub globals. It then requires
   `window.__DELTA_GAME_CONFIG__` to be a valid object.
1b. **Per-script sync errors are silently ignored** (`logger.debug` only). A
   script that throws before setting the config = config never set = relay
   logs `sim_warmup_failed: unable to load window.__DELTA_GAME_CONFIG__` and
   clients just see zero state_updates. One unreplaced `__MIN_PLAYERS__`
   placeholder cost us half a day — the build's sim gate now catches this.
1c. **Unhandled promise rejections KILL the sim session**
   (`session dead reason=unhandled_rejection`). An `await SharkyNet.ready()`
   that rejects in the sandbox is enough. Rule: every game script must no-op
   in the sim — start with `if (typeof SharkyNet === 'undefined') return;`
   (sharky-net itself exits early when `window.addEventListener` is missing).
   The build gate fails on leaked rejections.
1d. **Debugging**: relay+sim logs live in journald on the sg-relay hosts;
   `journalctl --since today | grep <gameId>` shows `sim join failed` /
   `sim_warmup_failed` with the exact fetch URL and error.
1e. **The sim's page fetch has a SIZE CAP** — `SIM_MAX_HTML_BYTES` in the
   sim-service `.env` (2,000,000 stock; prod sg-relays raised to 6,000,000
   on 2026-07-05). An oversized page (e.g. base64-embedded models) →
   `sim join failed status=500 "game html too large"` → `sim_warmup_failed`
   → clients see zero state_updates while everything else "works". Local
   build/publish pass fine — nothing client-side hints at it. A 4.65MB page
   warms in ~6s once under the cap. publish.ts warns above 2MB.

## Platform / publishing
2. **Supabase storage serves HTML as `text/plain` + nosniff** (bucket policy —
   the platform's own games hit this too; that's why Vercel deploys exist).
   `game_url` must point at a real text/html host. The preview host
   (`prod-game-maker.sharky.gg/api/preview`) works but expires in ~30 min.
3. **`user_games.authority_mode` is the sync-mode switch.** `server_sim` there →
   bootstrap hands every client `sync_mode: server_sim`. Rows can be created
   out-of-band (service key) and the platform honors them, including the
   private-game join guard.
4. **`private=1` blocks guest joins** ("only game owner can join private game").
5. **Platform sharky token: 1h TTL** (`exp-iat=3600`, standard Supabase JWT).
   The frontend refreshes on `error_code 10002` via `auth.refreshSession()`.
   Don't copy the browser's refresh token (rotation would log the user out) —
   a separate email-OTP session is the clean path (roadmap).
6. **guest_id must be a UUID** — other formats get `invalid guest id`.

## Relay / rooms

7. **player_action routing in host_client rooms is dead** (verified with
   elected-guest host AND owner-online host). Only server_sim rooms deliver
   client input (to the sim). Don't design anything on the host_client upstream.
8. **Relayed action payloads may lack user_id** — carry identity inside the op
   (sharky-net stamps `__tag`).
9. **Only the host connection may send `state_sync`** — anyone else gets an
   `error` frame back.
10. **Send the parent bootstrap postMessage ONCE.** Every
    `game:network-bootstrap` re-applies and reconnects the relay socket,
    leaving zombie room members that eat routing.
11. **Same account double-open = same user_id** — the relay may treat both as
    one seat. Use guest bootstraps for local two-client testing.
12. **Rate budget:** documented 20 action/s; a 40-op burst was accepted in
    practice. sharky-net throttles to ≤15/s — coalesce inputs (latest cursor
    pos, not every mousemove).

## Testing

13. **Background tabs freeze rAF games** (`document.hidden` → loop throttled).
    Use headless Playwright (pages report visible) for automated checks.
13b. **`players()` lists a client only after the room has seen ≥1 action from
    them — mock and real rooms behave the SAME** (real-room verified
    2026-07-07: two joined-but-silent guests both read an empty `players()`;
    the shim's `initPlayer` runs lazily on a client's first action, not on
    join). sharky-net self-registers on open with a system `SETKV`, so
    presence and lobby counts are correct before the game sends anything;
    the `__sys_presence` key never appears in `shared()`.
13c. **One keyboard, two panes: switching panes strands the previous pane's
    held keys** — the pane you leave never receives the keyup, so a
    `keys[...]` state map sticks and that character keeps moving on its own
    (reads as "both players respond to my input"). A `window` `blur` listener
    that clears the key map removes the class — real players alt-tab too.
    Single-keyboard testing in the two-pane mock room surfaces this within
    minutes.
14. **iframe URL matching in Playwright:** the parent URL can contain the game
    URL as a query param — match frames with `f !== page.mainFrame()`, not by
    substring alone.
15. **L1 lint scans raw source INCLUDING comments** — writing "localStorage"
    in a comment trips `forbidden_pattern` (matters if you also ship contract
    games; the shim template is already clean).

## Platform room semantics (why "multiplayer doesn't work" reports happen)

15b. **Clicking a game card creates a FRESH instance (= a new room).** Two
    people who each open the game independently are in two separate
    single-player rooms — game code is not involved and cannot fix it.
    Playing together means sharing the room: the platform's Invite button,
    or the full URL with its `instance_id`. Consequences:
    - test multiplayer via the invite/instance URL, never two card-clicks;
    - games should make room-ness legible: show the connected player count
      in the lobby, and when solo, say "friends join via the invite link"
      (players otherwise read an empty room as broken multiplayer);
    - publish.ts prints this reminder next to the play link.

15c. **Real-page role/identity resolution is ASYNC (seconds); mock is
    instant.** The bridge defaults to `role:'client'` until the parent's
    `game:network-bootstrap` postMessage lands, and host determination can
    additionally wait for the relay to report `host_user_id` — during that
    window `net.isHost()` is false for EVERYONE and `me().id` can still be
    `'local'`. Mock rooms resolve identity synchronously, so the window is
    structurally invisible offline (real-page verified 2026-07-08: a START
    gated by a one-shot `isHost()` check silently swallowed clicks for ~3s
    and the game read as "stuck in lobby" — initially misdiagnosed as a
    camera bug). `isHost()`/`me()` are live polls — reading them per frame
    observes the flip; the bridge also emits `delta:role-changed` each time
    the answer changes.

## Verification shape

16. **Sightless verification ships sighted bugs.** Rules distilled from real
    misses: input scripts must include TURNS and camera drags;
    assert over TIME (frame sequences), not single frames; test the user's
    actual viewport class (wide retina ≠ 1280×720 headless default); and put
    a human eyeball on the filmstrip before handover. The playtest gate
    (scripts/playtest-gate.ts) encodes all four.

## Latency model (measured)

- Op round trip (send → back in state_update): **min ~350ms · median ~400ms ·
  p95 ~780ms**. state_update cadence is steady.
- Design rule: **local echo immediately, reconcile on op order.** Party /
  turn-based / casual games need nothing else; twitch games need
  gameplay-level prediction (your logic owns it).
