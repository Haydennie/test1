# Hard parts, by genre — patterns that buy back multiplayer quality

The platform taxes exactly ONE thing: **player-to-player interaction density**
(the ~400ms ordered bus can't arbitrate real-time contact). Own-car feel,
visuals, audio, and solo content are untaxed — spend freely there. These
patterns claw back the taxed part. Use them; don't reinvent them mid-build.

## 0. The presence rig — seven bus facts every live-presence game handles

These follow from the transport itself (ordered log with replay, ≤15/s
throttle, ~400ms round trip), not from any genre — every game that shows
remote players re-derives the same answers (~200 lines each, measured
across three independent builds). The mechanics below are settled; the
entity style, interpolation feel, and all visuals remain entirely yours.
(Games with no live presence — turn-based, async — skip this section.)

1. **Self-echo**: your own ops come back through the ordered log.
   `if (meta.self) return` — you already echoed locally.
2. **Replayed history**: the log replays to (re)joiners — `meta.replayed`
   marks those ops. Streams carry "now" — skip them; world-*event* ops are
   the opposite: replay IS how latecomers catch up. A second staleness axis:
   a page frozen in the background drains its buffered updates in a burst on
   return — `meta.staleMs` (skew-immune sender-time age; offsets cancel,
   only clock rates matter) marks that backlog, so skipping stale stream ops
   lands the ghost at the LIVE position instead of replaying the missed
   trajectory. (Raw `Date.now() - op.__t` was the old cross-device trap:
   device clocks skew by seconds.)
3. **Throttle drops**: `send()` drops when over budget — coalesce streams
   (latest pose, not every frame); discrete must-arrive ops (finish, score,
   world event) go through `net.sendReliable()` instead. Host the stream on
   a TIMER, not the render loop: hidden/occluded pages freeze rAF to 0Hz
   but only throttle timers to ~1/s, so a covered window heartbeats instead
   of going silent (single-person two-window testing hits this constantly).
4. **Ghost lifecycle**: map `uid → entity`; create on first op, steer toward
   the latest pose each frame — but SNAP when the target is far (a page
   unfrozen after backgrounding drains its buffered updates in a burst;
   without a snap threshold the ghost visibly replays the missed trajectory
   instead of standing at the live position). EXISTENCE comes from the
   server roster, not stream cadence: `net.players()` drops real leavers
   (relay grace ~5s) while an idle/backgrounded player stays listed — render
   them STANDING at the last pose (mark idle after ~10s of silence); dispose
   shortly after they leave the roster, plus a long-silence backstop for
   mock rooms (their roster is sticky). Background pages get timers
   throttled to as little as 1/min — vanishing on silence turns every afk
   player into a "bug report".
5. **Lobby legibility**: show the connected count; when solo, say friends
   join via the Invite link (gotcha 15b — a fresh room otherwise reads as
   "multiplayer is broken").
6. **Shared world clock + platform-relative riders**: moving world objects
   (platforms, hazards, timed doors) must animate on ROOM time, not
   `performance.now()` — the local epoch is each page's load moment, so
   every client would render the same mover at a different phase.
   `state.clock` (sim seconds, whole-second steps) rides every `'update'`;
   anchor NTP-style — offset = MAX(sample) ever seen (the fastest-delivered
   packet is closest to true room time), advance purely on local monotonic
   time, re-baseline only on a large backward move (sim rewarm). Re-anchoring
   on every arrival injects network jitter into the world as a visible
   once-a-second lurch. And replicate
   RIDERS platform-relative (mover id + local offset in the pose): a frozen/
   backgrounded page stops simulating, so its broadcast absolute coords go
   stale — receivers re-base the offset onto their own shared-clock mover
   and the rider stays glued to it on every screen regardless of the
   sender's cadence.
7. **Identity display**: player names live in `net.players()[uid].name`
   (platform nicknames; they arrive/update via the `'players'` event —
   re-label ghosts when it fires). `op.__tag` / `net.tag` is a transport
   tag, NOT identity — never show it. Mock rooms only have placeholder
   identities, so a wrong name source is INVISIBLE offline: check names in
   the real room (room-test asserts delivery, not display — a session
   shipped transport tags as player names and no apparatus caught it).

```js
const ghosts = {};                                   // uid -> { entity, target, lastSeen }
net.on('op', (op, meta) => {
  if (op.k === 'pose') {                                     // stream op
    if (meta.self || meta.uid === net.me().id) return;       // 1: own stream already echoed
    if (meta.replayed || meta.staleMs > 3000) return;        // 2: history / catch-up backlog
    const g = ghosts[meta.uid] ||= { entity: makeGhostEntity(meta.uid) }; // 4
    // name it from net.players()[meta.uid]?.name, NOT op.__tag — see 7
    g.target = op; g.lastSeen = performance.now();
  }
  // world-event ops invert BOTH rules: the sender applies its own event from
  // the bus as well (a top-of-handler self-skip leaves the clicker in a
  // private round), and replayed events are consumed — see 2               // 1+2
});
function stepGhosts(dt) {                                     // 4: per frame
  for (const [uid, g] of Object.entries(ghosts)) {
    steerToward(g.entity, g.target, dt);   // lerp / dead-reckon — feel is yours
    const here = !!net.players()[uid];     // 4: existence = server roster
    g.entity.visible = here;               //    (afk ≠ gone; silence only stales motion)
    const silent = performance.now() - g.lastSeen;
    if ((!here && silent > 5000) || silent > 60000) { disposeEntity(g.entity); delete ghosts[uid]; }
  }
}
setInterval(() => net.send({ k: 'pose', ...latestPose }), 90); // 3: timer-hosted lossy stream
net.sendReliable({ k: 'finish', ms });               // 3: results must arrive
```

`makeGhostEntity` / `steerToward` / `disposeEntity` are deliberately not
provided — that's the creative half.

**Degrade contract** (`net.quality()` / `on('connection', {kind:'quality'})`,
tiers change with ~1s-in/~2s-out hysteresis so UI can bind directly):
- `degraded` (smoothed op RTT >0.8s, or updates 1-3s stale): widen
  interpolation buffers, damp cosmetic motion, lengthen claim suspense
  windows, show a subtle ⚠.
- `critical` (disconnected, or the world >3s stale): reconnect notice,
  gate hard-commit inputs, keep simulating locally.

## 1. Ghost soft-contact (zero platform involvement)

Remote players are dead-reckoned ghosts. You still get contact FEEL by
resolving collisions **locally only** — each client moves its own object
out of ghost overlap; nobody arbitrates, small divergence is fine for
casual play, and your own object stays locally authoritative so nothing
conflicts.

Measured (2026-07-07, kart racer built from this file's earlier
velocity-spring snippet): a velocity-only nudge is imperceptible at
driving speed — peak push ≈3% of vehicle speed across the ~0.08s overlap
window reads as driving straight THROUGH the other player. Position
resolution (clamp yourself out of the overlap, exactly like a wall hit)
is the form that feels solid. Ghost poses lag ~0.4–0.5s behind the
remote's true position, so this is casual-fair rather than esports-exact
— the same trade the big kart games ship online.

```js
for (const uid in ghosts) {                        // per frame, per ghost — any player count
  const g = ghosts[uid], dx = me.x - g.x, dz = me.z - g.z;
  const d = Math.hypot(dx, dz), R = MY_R + GHOST_R;
  if (d > 1e-4 && d < R) {
    me.x = g.x + (dx / d) * R;  me.z = g.z + (dz / d) * R;  // clamp out, wall-style
    const vn = (me.vx * dx + me.vz * dz) / d;               // kill inward velocity
    if (vn < 0) { me.vx -= (dx / d) * vn; me.vz -= (dz / d) * vn; }
    bumpFeedback();                                 // shake/sfx — the point is feel
  }
}
// each client clamps ITSELF only — symmetric on every peer, zero authority conflict
// bonus: slipstream = speed boost when closely trailing a ghost's heading
```

## 2. Authoritative rules script (`__SHARKY_RULES__`)

For outcomes that MUST be fair — first-come pickups, photo finishes,
scoring — ship a **pure-logic rules script** on the page:

```html
<script>
/* PURE logic: no DOM, no SharkyNet, deterministic. Runs BOTH in the
   platform sim (authoritative) and locally (optimistic preview). */
window.__SHARKY_RULES__ = {
  init(game) { game.ms = 0; game.pickups = {}; game.score = {}; },
  onTick(game, dt) { game.ms += dt * 1000; /* respawns, timers */ },
  onOp(game, op, uid) {
    // Fair first-claim under mixed latencies: raw bus order hands every
    // contested pickup to the lowest-RTT player. Arbitrate on CLAMPED
    // sender time instead — a later-ARRIVING claim may still win if it was
    // SENT earlier, within an 800ms decision window (≈p95 RTT; also the
    // ceiling on what a backdated timestamp could steal).
    if (op.k !== 'claim') return;
    const t = Number(op.__t) || 0;              // sharky-net stamps __t on send
    const cur = game.pickups[op.id];
    if (!cur) {
      game.pickups[op.id] = { uid, t, openUntil: game.ms + 800 };
      game.score[uid] = (game.score[uid] || 0) + 1;
    } else if (game.ms <= cur.openUntil && t && cur.t && t < cur.t) {
      game.score[cur.uid] -= 1;                 // photo-finish reversal
      game.score[uid] = (game.score[uid] || 0) + 1;
      cur.uid = uid; cur.t = t;
    }
  },
};
// Client side: pair with net.claim(op, cb) — play the grab animation as
// "pending" immediately, reveal the outcome when cb fires (and reconcile
// against net.game() in case a photo-finish reversal landed).
</script>
```

- The build's shim delegates OP/tick to it; rules state lives in
  `state.game` and reaches every client via `net.game()` (~400ms).
- **Pattern: optimistic + reconcile.** Apply the same rules locally the
  moment you send the op (instant feedback), then reconcile from
  `net.game()` — if the sim says someone else won the claim, roll back
  your local effect. Same code both sides = no drift in logic.
- Hygiene: the script must NOT carry the `typeof SharkyNet` guard (it must
  run in the sim), must not touch DOM/timers, keep state JSON-serializable
  and small (it rides every state_update).
- In mock rooms (dev-serve / gate) sharky-net runs the rules locally in bus
  order, so `net.game()` behaves identically offline.

## 2.5 Visual affordance: solid-looking props must act solid

Players WILL drive/walk into everything on screen. Anything with visual
mass either gets a collider or lives out of reach — pass-through solids
read as broken (real playtest report). Static props are trivial:

```js
// registration (at creation): OBSTACLES.push({ x, z, r: 0.9 })
// resolution (per physics step): push-out + impact-angle speed loss
for (const o of OBSTACLES) {
  const dx = me.x - o.x, dz = me.z - o.z, rr = o.r + MY_R, d2 = dx*dx + dz*dz;
  if (d2 >= rr*rr || d2 < 1e-6) continue;
  const d = Math.sqrt(d2), nx = dx/d, nz = dz/d;
  me.x = o.x + nx*rr; me.z = o.z + nz*rr;                    // never inside
  const impact = Math.max(0, -(fwdX*nx + fwdZ*nz));          // 1 = head-on
  me.v *= 1 - 0.75 * impact;                                 // hit feel
}
```

(Intentional pass-through — ghosts, top-down puzzles — is fine when the
LOOK says so. The principle is affordance consistency, not "physics
everywhere".)

The same law covers **room-level verbs**: a control that LOOKS shared — a
start button, a countdown, a "new round" — must act on the ROOM
(`net.start()` / shared state), never just locally. A 发车 button that only
dismissed the clicker's own intro overlay read as "start sync is broken" to
the other player (real two-player report).

## 3. Racing crib (the three subsystems that decide feel)

- **Camera**: smooth in ANGLE space, not world space —
  `camYaw += angDiff(targetYaw, camYaw) * (1 - e^(-k·dt))`, then place the
  camera from camYaw; look AT the car (taper any look-ahead to zero while
  the user orbits). World-space position lerp loses the car in sustained
  turns (measured failure, gotcha #16).
- **Fixed-timestep physics**: accumulate dt, step at 120Hz, clamp
  accumulator; feel becomes framerate-independent.
- **Slip decomposition**: track longitudinal/lateral velocity separately,
  decay lateral exponentially (grip), and add full-lock tire scrub so
  donuts converge instead of spiraling.

## 4. What NOT to fight

- Don't build peer-to-peer physics consensus over the bus — 400ms makes it
  rubber-band garbage. Ghosts + local feel + rules arbitration is the
  correct trio.
- Don't hide latency with lockstep waits — never block the local loop on a
  bus confirm.
